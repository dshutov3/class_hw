			<p align = "right"> Even here, we are able to see Picasso's skill, potraying a dog in only <b>one line</b>. Although known <br> for his work and influence in <i>cubism</i> and <i>surrealism</i>, it is these sketches <br> that seem to have the most impact to my creativity. His sketches <br> are simple, yet elegant; exactly how'd you prefer a Website to be. </p>

 			<figcaption>"Pablo Picasso (/pɪˈkɑːsoʊ, -ˈkæsoʊ/;[2] Spanish: [ˈpaβlo piˈkaso]; 25 October <br>1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, stage <br>designer, poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in France. Regarded as one <br>of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the <br>Cubist movement, the invention of constructed sculpture,[3][4] the co-invention of <br>collage, and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his <br>most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907), and Guernica <br> (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by the German and Italian <br>airforces." - Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso"> Wikipedia </a></figcaption>
