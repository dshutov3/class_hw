		Gregory of Tours’ Historiae (History of Franks) and Bede’s Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People) were both justly named by the scholars who wrote them; they were histories. While Gregory of Tours was a bishop, and Bede was a monk, the two wrote their histories to describe the periods in which they lived and the historical events that took place during. However, deeper analysis shows that they key methods in which each author described their respective location differ immensely. Whether it was how Gregory of Tours described the early history of the Franks up until the 6th Century, or how Bede portrayed the history of the Anglo-Saxons and the Northumbrian peoples, the methodologies used, when broken down, show specific models that are unique to each author. Although different in writing, contemporary historians are able to attach three main topics of discussion to view the differences between the two authors: the form of the writing, the topic Ethnogenesis, and the topic Christianization. From these focuses, we able to see that although Bede and Gregory were writing historical works, they were writing with their own personal motives. Whether it was for the glory of their people, the spread of their religion, or the prestige of being the author of an ecclesiastical work about their people, Bede and Gregory differed in the way they depicted the histories of their people.

		The first topic in which we are able to view the differences between Bede and Gregory is by comparing the framing and writing of their work. Each text is split up into separate books, each book dedicated to a specific timeframe, which the author goes over the events that have occurred. However, the timelines for each of the texts are vastly different. Gregory of Tours’ The History of the Franks is split into 10 books, the first book spanning over 5,596 years. It begins with the ancient history of the world, starting with the Creation, with each book and chapter dialing in more into the history of the Franks, the history of the Gauls, and eventually the history of Tours. With this top-down approach to his writing, Gregory was able to give the illusion that Tours was the center of the world. Gregory was also able to use each book to show a progression from bad to good. Moving from the “godless King” Chilperic I and his death from Books V and VI, and the eventual change to the “good King” Guntram in Books VII through XI, Gregory is able to show a progression from the primitive times to the a “contemporary”, modern history that Gregory now lived in, highlighting how good the Christianization of Gaul was for the culture as a whole.

		However, Bede takes a different approach compared to Gregory’s. Split into 5 books, the Ecclesiastical History of the English People begins with Julius Caesar’s campaigns during the Gallic Wars into Briton, but quickly shifts his focus on to Anglo-Saxon people, covering a much shorter amount of time, and concentrating on painting a vivid portrait of not only English People, but also of the Church during his time. Also, unlike Gregory, Bede seems to not include as much violence as Gregory does in his work. Instead, Bede focuses more on miracles to further pushing his purpose, stating “…if history records good things of good men, the thoughtful reader is encouraged to imitate what is good; if it records evil of wicked men, the devout reader is encouraged to avoid all that is sinful and perverse”.  In this case, miracles for Bede functioned as a model; something to help live by and to teach by moral. As you can see, the timelines of these works were extremely unalike, which followed suit with the themes and models the two authors wanted to project.

		Another topic that is typically discussed to show the discrepancies between Bede’s and Gregory’s works is the creation of their respective peoples into a group; ethnogenesis. Both Gregory and Bede are seen to use their works to spread Christianity, but this also might have caused the unintended consequence of creating an ethnical group for their society. However, this formation of their people definitely seems much more apparent in Bede’s work than it does for Gregory. Bede’s work may seem as an active ethnogenesis, where his narratives slowly molded the Anglo-Saxons congregating to a selective people as the geography’s language changed from Latin/Celtic language to Anglo-Saxon, and Christianity replacing the Pagan religions that were there before.

		As you can see, although the Bede and Gregory were both writing works to signify and portray a perfect history of their people, each were using a different set of models and methods to do so. Within the topics of their types of writing, Christianity, and ethnogenesis, you are able to see the true purpose in which each author is writing with. Bede’s ideology is clear; he writes with a moral purpose of ecclesiastical history to represent the religion and politics that Northumbria had at the time. He uses plenty of primary sources, weighs these source accounts against one another to provide an accurate history, and emphasizes stories of “good” to illuminate and inspire the people. Through his writing, Bede is able to highlight the transition of his land from “diversity to unity”.  Gregory of Tours similarly highlights miracles that occur throughout Historiae, but also uses violence to propagate the need of Christianity. He also shows the “good” that Christianity may bring to a people, but not before indicating the violent beginning that was before. Thus, although Bede and Gregory write for the same purpose, the ways in which they present their histories differ greatly.
